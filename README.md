clone this repo and switch to branch : add_basic_schema_and_service
(No need to clone the repo again if you have already cloned it once. you can just switch to above mentioned branch)


Below steps have been taken ==>
* Added schema file in db folder and service file in srv folder
( You can use any word for namespace in schema file and for service file you need to follow "namespace-service.cds" naming convention )

What you need to do ==>
* Check the schema and service in db and srv folders respectively.
* use "cd Project_Student_Details" command in terminal to go inside the folder and use command "cds watch" to check the metadata on port 4004
* once you have checked metadata , use CTRL+C in Terminal to stop the local server
