* use "cd Project_Student_Details" to go inside the folder and use command "cds watch" to check the app on port 4004 
* You can see that : 
 -there is no selection field apart from default "search" selection
 -the column's label is fieldname but not some meaningful labels
 -few columns are not getting displayed by default and can only be displayed by clicking on settings button on UI
 -there is only 1 facet (General information) on detail page

* Open the file annotations.cds in the path app/project1 and check added required annotations.
* In case you want to add any other annotation , you can refer https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/fiori
